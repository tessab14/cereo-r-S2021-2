<!-- Line breaks -->

Line 1  
Line 2

Line 1 <br>
Line 2

\* `<br>` only starts a new line, not a new paragraph 

<!-- Paragraph -->

Topic 1. It's such a fascinating paragraph  

Topic 2: Some more great stuff  

Topic 3: Blah blah Blah 

<!-- Footnotes -->

Here is a sentence that requires a footnote [^1]. This sentence follows the footnote.  

[^1]: Here is our first footnote. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
